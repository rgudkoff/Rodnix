# RodNIX Public License v1.0 (RPL-1.0)

Based on GNU AGPLv3 with additional commercial-use terms.

## PREAMBLE

RodNIX is free and open for the community to study, modify, improve, and build
upon. All non-commercial use is free. Community developers may use RodNIX for
personal, educational, research, artistic, hobby, and independent commercial
projects.

is distributed to contributors.
