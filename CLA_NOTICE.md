# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors must sign the CLA before their Pull Requests can be merged.

Why CLA?
- Ensures legal clarity and copyright compliance.
- Allows the project to evolve, re-license, or dual-license if necessary.
- Protects contributors and the Owner.

The CLA grants:
- Non-exclusive rights for the project to use your contribution.
- Permission for redistribution, modification, and re-licensing.

The CLA does NOT:
- Transfer your personal copyright
- Limit your rights to use your own contribution elsewhere

Instructions for signing the CLA will be provided in the repository.
